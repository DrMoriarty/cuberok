Cuberok is yet another music player based on Qt4

Compiling & Installation
------------------------

In order to compile Cuberok from sources you need Qt4 >= 4.4.0, TagLib and one of the
engines (Audiere, GStreamer 0.10, ...). Then run following commands:

	qmake Cuberok.pro
	make
	sudo make install INSTALL_ROOT=/usr/local

All plugins except phonon will be builded if it is possible. Phonon plugin require 
config flag at Qt <= 4.4. Type

	qmake "CONFIG+=player_phonon" Cuberok.pro

instead of 'qmake Cuberok.pro' in previous paragraph.
In order to disable build of plugin use flag 'disable_<pluginname>' or use 'disable_all'
to disable all of them. For example following line disables build of gstreamer plugin:

    qmake "CONFIG+=disable_gst" Cuberok.pro

All config flags are:
	player_phonon
	disable_all
	disable_audiere
	disable_gst
	disable_phonon
	disable_ffmpeg

Compiling in Windows
--------------------

In order to compile Cuberok in Windows you need taglib and at least one audio engine.
Download audiere (http://audiere.sourceforge.net/download.php) or gstreamer 
(http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/pkg/windows/releases/) with glib 
(http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html).

Then put they into the sources directory:
cuberok/taglib
cuberok/audiere
cuberok/glib
cuberok/gstreamer

Also you need Qt opensource edition version 4.3.1 or later with MinGW.
Then run `win_build.bat` and wait a minute.

If you want to make a windows installer, you must install NSIS from 
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download. After installation run NSIS and 
compile cuberok.nsi with it.
